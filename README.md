# Face Detection and Tracking Model
This repository contains a face detection and tracking model using OpenCV's pre-trained Caffe model (res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel) for face detection and Deep SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric) for tracking.

## Overview
Face Detection: Utilizes the res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel pre-trained model to detect faces in images or video frames.
Face Tracking: Uses Deep SORT to track detected faces across multiple frames.
Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

# Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV
Deep SORT
Other dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)
# Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the Pre-trained Model
Download the Caffe model:

You need to download the res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel file. You can download it from the official OpenCV repository.

#Save the model:

Save the downloaded res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel file in the models folder of the repository. Create the models folder if it does not exist:

bash
Copy code
mkdir models
mv path/to/downloaded/res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel models/
Usage
#Run Face Detection and Tracking:

You can run the face detection and tracking script on a video file or webcam feed. Replace input_video.mp4 with the path to your video file, or use 0 for webcam input.

bash
Copy code
python detect_and_track.py --input input_video.mp4 --output output_video.mp4
#Options:

--input: Path to the input video file or 0 for webcam.
--output: Path to save the output video with tracked faces.
Example
Here is an example command to run the script:

bash
Copy code
python detect_and_track.py --input video.mp4 --output tracked_output.mp4
